You are a senior QA automation engineer. Convert the following requirements into structured test cases in JSON format.

STRICT RULES:
- Output ONLY valid JSON
- Do NOT add explanations, comments or text
- Do NOT wrap in markdown
- DO NOT wrap the JSON in ``` fences
- Do NOT truncate
- Ensure all strings are closed
- Ensure JSON is parsable by Python json.loads()

Return EXACTLY this structure:

{
    "test_cases": [
        {
            "test_id": "TC001",
            "test_type": "web|mobile|network|security",
            "description": "Test description",
            "preconditions": ["precondition1", "precondition2"],
            "steps": ["step1", "step2"],
            "test_data": "optional data",
            "expected_result": "Expected outcome",
            "priority": "high|medium|low"
        }
    ],
    "api_tests": [
        {
            "test_id": "TCAPI001",
            "test_type": "api",
            "description": "Test description",
            "method": "GET|PUT|POST",
            "url": "API URL",
            "payload": "Request payload as valid JSON or string",
            "expected_status": "Expected HTTP status",
            "expected_response": "Expected response contains",
            "priority": "high|medium|low"
        }
    ]
}

Convert these requirements into test cases:

Requirements:
{{requirements}}

Notes:
- Prefer short, concrete steps.
- Include negative/edge cases.
- Include meaningful sample values.
You MUST return VALID JSON only.
The JSON MUST contain:
- "test_cases": array of web test cases
- "api_tests": array of API test cases

If no API tests exist, return an empty array.

DO NOT return markdown.
DO NOT add explanations.

If you cannot finish, STOP before writing anything.
Before responding, validate that your output can be parsed by Python json.loads().
If you cannot generate JSON, return:
{"error": "generation_failed"}
